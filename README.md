# Smart Crossing

This project implements a Smart Crossing Testbed for pedestrian and driver safety, at UFES (Universidade Federal do Esp√≠rito Santo). Currently being developed.

## Objectives
The objective of this project is to implement a Digital Twin Infrastructure using data gathered by IoT Devices at traffic crossings, in order to predict dangerous scenarios and allert drivers and pedestrians, improving overall safety in those crossings.
That is done by using the FIWARE Open Source Software Stack to implement all the network services necessary for storing, accessing, securing and visualizing data.
